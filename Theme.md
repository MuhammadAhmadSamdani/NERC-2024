# National Engineering Robotics Contest (NERC) 2024 - Indigenous Category

## Overview

Welcome to the 20th National Engineering Robotics Contest (NERC) 2024, a collaborative initiative between the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and the STEM Careers Programme (HEC). This contest is organized by the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at the College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (CEME), NUST, and the National Centre of Robotics and Automation (NCRA).

## Theme

The theme for NERC 2024 focuses on developing an autonomous robot for a tree plantation drive. The robot must prepare the soil by removing rocks and garbage and then plant trees at designated locations. The team whose robot completes the task first and reaches the finish line will be declared the winner.

## Categories

The contest consists of two main categories:

1. **Indigenous Robot Category**
   - Robots are constructed from scratch.
   - Teams design and manufacture all mechanical structures, controls, and electronic modules.

2. **Modular Robot Category**
   - Robots are developed using ready-made kits (e.g., Lego, EV3 kits, EDVON kits, NCRA robotic kits).
   - Further divided into subcategories:
     - **Modular School**
       - Lego School
       - Ready to Race School
     - **Modular University**
       - Lego University
       - Ready to Race University

This document describes the theme for the Indigenous Robot Category.

## Contest Structure

The contest consists of two stages:

1. **Qualifying Rounds**
   - Robots compete individually.
   - Points and time determine seeding positions.

2. **Head-to-Head Matches**
   - Top 32 teams from the qualifying rounds compete in knockout matches.
   - The final match determines the winner, and the runner-up is decided based on semifinal results.

## Contest Theme Details

The NERC 2024 theme is based on an automated tree plantation drive involving task planning and scheduling. Key details include:

- **Arena Construction**: Laminated wooden sheets with a white floor and 5-inch high boundary walls.
- **Starting Position**: Robots start behind a solid black line.
- **Tree Plantation Field**: A 3x3 grid where trees must be planted after soil preparation.
- **Rocks and Trees**: Three rocks and three trees are initially placed in the field. Their exact positions are specified by a rock position map.
- **Robot Tasks**: Remove rocks from the field and plant trees in designated locations.
- **Object Placement**: Rocks and trees must be placed within red-marked regions.

## Robot Operation

- **Qualifying Rounds**: Each robot runs individually within a maximum of 4 minutes. Multiple retries are allowed without penalties.
- **Head-to-Head Matches**: Robots compete side by side. Teams are designated as Team A or Team B based on a coin toss.

## Rules and Regulations

- **Robot Size**: Maximum dimensions are 12x12 inches (LxW).
- **Robot Type**: Must be autonomous and indigenously developed.
- **Retry Procedure**: Teams can reset their robots during retries.
- **Disqualification**: Violation of rules can lead to disqualification.
